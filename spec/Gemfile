# This Gemfile is only really for TESTING - Project is a gem that sits inside a Spree Rails APP

# DEFINE VERSIONS YOU WANT TO TEST AGAINST HERE
# THIS SHOULD BASICALLY REPLICATE WHAT IS IN THE SANDBOX GEMFILE

# N.B Spree will update the sandbox Gemfile with additional Spree gems
# e,g User model and Authorisation
# For rspec you  may need to add them in here or you'll get missing Spree constants
# TODO - update  sandbox code so it automatically adds Spree gems in here
